🤖 Agent WorkflowRetrieval (The Tool): The system queries ChromaDB to fetch context-specific guides (e.g., isa_guide.txt) relevant to the user's question.Agent 1: The Librarian (Generator):Model: Gemini 2.5 Flash.Role: Synthesizes the retrieved data into the "Savvy Capybara" persona.Goal: Educational, jargon-free, and encouraging.Agent 2: The Guardian (Critique):Model: Gemini 2.5 Flash.Role: Acts as a Financial Compliance Officer.Goal: Reviews Agent 1's draft to remove direct financial advice (e.g., changing "You should buy..." to "Some people use..."), ensures UK-specific terminology, and verifies safety.🛠️ Tech StackLLM: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (via google-generativeai)Vector Database: ChromaDB (Persistent local storage)Interface: StreamlitLanguage: Python 3.11Deployment: Streamlit Cloud (Compatible with pysqlite3-binary)📊 Evaluation & QualityTo ensure Cappy gives safe and helpful advice, we prioritize Evaluation as a core architectural pillar.1. The Golden Dataset (eval_questions.csv)We maintain a curated dataset of questions covering high-risk topics (Overdrafts, Debt) and factual topics (ISAs). This ensures we can regress-test the agent against known good answers.2. The "Guardian" Protocol (Safety)We strictly adhere to the "Agents for Good" track requirements by implementing a specific Guardrails Layer. The Guardian Agent enforces:No Direct Advice: Shifts language from directive ("Do this") to descriptive ("This is how it works").Geographic Constraint: Ensures advice is relevant to UK HMRC/FCA rules, not US laws.🚀 Installation & Setup1.
