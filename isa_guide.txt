TITLE: The Complete Guide to ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts)

WHAT IS IT?
Think of an ISA as a "tax-proof wrapper" for your money. Normally, if you make a lot of profit on investments or interest on savings, the government wants a cut (tax). If you put that money inside an ISA wrapper, the government can't touch it. It is entirely tax-free forever.

THE GOLDEN RULES
1. The Limit: You can only put in £20,000 per tax year (across all your ISAs combined).
2. The Reset: The allowance resets every April 6th. If you don't use it, you lose it.

THE FOUR MAIN TYPES (AND WHEN TO USE THEM)

1. Cash ISA
- Best for: Short-term goals (holidays, emergency funds) or if you are scared of the stock market.
- Pros: Safe, guaranteed returns, easy access.
- Cons: Interest rates might be lower than inflation (your money loses buying power over time).

2. Stocks & Shares ISA
- Best for: Long-term wealth (5+ years).
- Pros: Historically creates much more money than cash.
- Cons: The value goes up and down. You could lose money in the short term.

3. Lifetime ISA (LISA)
- Best for: Buying your first home.
- The Hack: The government adds a 25% free bonus to whatever you save (up to £4,000/year). That is up to £1,000 free cash annually.
- The Catch: You must be 18-39 to open one. If you withdraw the money for anything other than a house (or retirement), you pay a heavy 25% penalty.

4. Innovative Finance ISA
- Best for: Advanced investors who want to lend money to businesses (P2P lending).
- Risk: High. You could lose all your money if the borrowers default.
