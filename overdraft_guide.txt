TITLE: The Student Overdraft Survival Guide

WHAT IS IT?
An overdraft is a debt facility attached to your debit card. It lets you spend money you don't actually have, taking your balance below zero (e.g., -£500).

THE "FREE MONEY" TRAP
Student accounts often come with a 0% interest overdraft (e.g., up to £1,500).
- MYTH: "It's free money from the bank!"
- REALITY: It is a loan. When you graduate, the 0% deal ends. If you haven't paid it back by then, the bank will start charging you huge interest fees.

WHEN TO USE IT (THE "EMERGENCY ONLY" RULE)
- GOOD USE: Your rent is due on the 1st, but your student loan drops on the 3rd. Use the overdraft to bridge the gap for 2 days.
- BAD USE: Buying a PS5, clothes, or rounds of drinks. You are literally borrowing money to buy these things.

PROS AND CONS
- Pros: It prevents your payments from "bouncing" (failing), which protects your credit score. It is a vital safety net for emergencies.
- Cons: It is too easy to live in it permanently. It lowers your "real" bank balance.

THE GRADUATION TRAP
Once you leave uni, banks will slowly shrink your overdraft limit (e.g., from £2,000 to £1,000). If you are still spending at the old limit, you will be hit with unarranged overdraft fees, which can damage your credit rating for years.
